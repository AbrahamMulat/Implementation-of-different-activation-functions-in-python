# Implementation-of-different-activation-functions-in-python
A python implementation to plot different activation functions in neural network.

In Artificial neural network (ANN), activation functions are typically used to transform an input into an output. 
They decides whether a neuron should be activated or not by applying mathematical operations. This means an activation function can determine whether or not the neurons's input to the network is significant during the predicition process.
This repository contains a python implementation to plot various types of commonly used activation functions in Python.
